# SplitDine Task Management Guide

## Overview
This document outlines our task management approach for the SplitDine MVP implementation. We're using a structured, phase-based approach to ensure systematic progress and clear milestones.

## Task Structure

### Phase-Based Organization
The project is divided into 6 main phases:
1. **Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation**
2. **Phase 2: Backend Infrastructure** 
3. **Phase 3: OCR & Receipt Processing**
4. **Phase 4: Core App Features**
5. **Phase 5: Payment Integration**
6. **Phase 6: Testing & Polish**

### Task States
- `[ ]` **NOT_STARTED** - Tasks not yet begun
- `[/]` **IN_PROGRESS** - Currently active tasks
- `[x]` **COMPLETE** - Finished and verified tasks
- `[-]` **CANCELLED** - Tasks no longer relevant

## Working Approach

### Sequential Phase Development
- Complete one phase before moving to the next
- Each phase builds upon the previous one
- Regular review points between phases

### Task Granularity
- Each task represents ~20 minutes of professional development work
- Tasks are specific and actionable
- Clear acceptance criteria for completion

### Progress Tracking
- Update task status as work progresses
- Mark tasks complete only after verification
- Document any blockers or issues encountered

- UI/UX refinements
- Deployment readiness

## Review Process

### Phase Completion Reviews
At the end of each phase:
1. Verify all tasks are complete
2. Test phase deliverables
3. Review code quality and documentation
4. Plan any necessary adjustments
5. Approve progression to next phase

### Weekly Progress Reviews
- Review completed tasks
- Identify any blockers
- Adjust timeline if needed
- Plan upcoming work

### Task Completion Criteria
Each task should meet these criteria before marking complete:
- Functionality works as specified
- Code follows development guidelines
- Tests are written and passing
- Documentation is updated
- Code review is completed

## Risk Management

### Common Risks
- **API Integration Issues**: External services may have limitations
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Real-time features may impact performance  
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Payment and data handling require careful implementation
- **User Experience Issues**: Complex flows may confuse users

### Mitigation Strategies
- Build fallback mechanisms for external dependencies
- Performance testing throughout development
- Security reviews at each phase
- User testing and feedback incorporation

## Communication

### Status Updates
- Daily progress on current tasks
- Weekly phase progress reports
- Immediate notification of blockers
- Regular stakeholder updates

### Documentation
- Keep task descriptions current
- Document decisions and rationale
- Maintain technical specifications
- Update user guides as features develop

## Tools and Resources

### Task Tracking
- Use built-in task management system
- Regular task status updates
- Clear task descriptions and acceptance criteria

### Development Tools
- Flutter development environment
- Firebase console and tools
- Version control (Git)
- Testing frameworks

### External Services
- Google Vision API for OCR
- OpenAI API for parsing
- Stripe for payments
- Firebase for backend services

## Success Metrics

### Phase-Level Metrics
- On-time phase completion
- Quality of deliverables
- Test coverage achieved
- Documentation completeness

### Overall Project Metrics
- MVP feature completeness
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security requirements satisfied
- User experience quality

## Next Steps

1. **Review this task structure** and provide feedback
2. **Begin Phase 1** with environment setup
3. **Establish regular check-ins** for progress tracking
4. **Create detailed specifications** for each upcoming phase
5. **Set up monitoring and reporting** for project health

This structured approach ensures we build SplitDine systematically while maintaining quality and meeting our MVP goals.
