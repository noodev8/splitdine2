# SplitDine Development Guidelines

## Code Organization

### Project Structure
```
lib/
├── main.dart
├── app/
│   ├── app.dart
│   └── routes.dart
├── core/
│   ├── constants/
│   ├── errors/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── services/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── session/
│   ├── receipt/
│   ├── payment/
│   └── shared/
└── data/
    ├── models/
    ├── repositories/
    └── datasources/
```

### Feature-Based Architecture
Each feature should contain:
- `presentation/` - UI components and state management
- `domain/` - Business logic and entities
- `data/` - Data sources and repositories

## Coding Standards

### Dart/Flutter Best Practices
- Follow official Dart style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling
- Write comprehensive documentation
- Use const constructors where possible

### State Management
- Use Provider or Riverpod for state management
- Separate business logic from UI logic
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Use immutable data models

### Firebase Integration
- Use Firebase SDK best practices
- Implement proper offline handling
- Use security rules effectively
- Monitor usage and costs

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch
- `feature/task-name` - Feature development
- `hotfix/issue-name` - Critical fixes

### Commit Messages
```
type(scope): description

feat(auth): add anonymous user authentication
fix(receipt): resolve OCR parsing edge case
docs(api): update Firebase function documentation
test(session): add unit tests for splitting logic
```

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Create PR with detailed description
5. Code review and approval required
6. Merge to `develop` after CI passes

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All business logic must have unit tests
- Critical user flows need integration tests
- UI components should have widget tests

### Test Organization
```
test/
├── unit/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   └── utils/
├── widget/
│   └── features/
└── integration/
    └── flows/
```

### Testing Best Practices
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Explain complex algorithms
- Document breaking changes

### README Files
Each feature should have a README explaining:
- Purpose and functionality
- Usage instructions
- Dependencies
- Testing approach

## Performance Guidelines

### Flutter Performance
- Minimize widget rebuilds
- Use const constructors
- Implement proper list virtualization
- Optimize image loading and caching

### Firebase Performance
- Use efficient query patterns
- Implement proper pagination
- Monitor real-time listener usage
- Optimize security rules

### Network Optimization
- Implement request caching
- Use compression for images
- Handle offline scenarios
- Implement retry logic

## Security Practices

### Data Protection
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before storage
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper authentication

### API Security
- Secure API keys and secrets
- Use Firebase security rules
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### Payment Security
- Follow PCI compliance guidelines
- Never store sensitive payment data
- Use Stripe's secure payment flows
- Implement fraud detection
