Split Item
Next we need to manage items that are split equally in price between participants.

Lets have a new screen called "Split Items"

Very similiar to adding individual items for a session, except we are adding only split items. Two parts to this
1 - The screen which lists all the split items for the session with which guest is a part of that split. Have a menu at the bottom, "add split". If the item in the list was tapped, a popup appears with a scrollable list of guests and allows clicking which guest is a part or not a part of that splt.
2 - The screen which allows adding a split item. The name, the total cost. This is arrived from screen 1 above "Add Split"

Use the below design only for these screens, and keep all UI, styles and logic in their own file. Do not change other parts of the app apart from the session home page where you add a button (simple button) for "Split Item"

- Design Rules for these screens only. Not other parts of the app
- Use Material 3 theming.
- Use Google Sans Rounded Bold for headings.
- Use Nunito Regular 24pt for body text.
- Set these brand colors:
  - Primary: #FFC629 (Sunshine Yellow)
  - Secondary: #F04438 (Tomato Red)
  - Background: #FFFFFF
  - Surface: #ECE9E6
  - Error: #F04438
  - OnPrimary: #000000
  - OnSecondary: #FFFFFF
  - OnBackground: #4E4B47
  - OnSurface: #4E4B47


Logic and data
Ive updated DB_Schema which now incldes a table caled split_items. Use this table to add to, and lookup details.
