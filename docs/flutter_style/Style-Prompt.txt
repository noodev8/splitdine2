- Use Google Sans Rounded Bold for headings.
- Use Nunito Regular 24pt for body text.
- Set these brand colors:
  - Primary: #FFC629 (Sunshine Yellow)
  - Secondary: #F04438 (Tomato Red)
  - Background: #FFFFFF
  - Surface: #ECE9E6
  - Error: #F04438
  - OnPrimary: #000000
  - OnSecondary: #FFFFFF
  - OnBackground: #4E4B47
  - OnSurface: #4E4B47


The intention of the guest screen has changed slightly. I want it to be a place where we can see the total of their selected items, and the items themselves.
Each guest will have a header with total and below, with the items. All displayed on the same screen
