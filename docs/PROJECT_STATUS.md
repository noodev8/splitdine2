### Flutter App Status
- ✅ **Authentication working** - Email/password and anonymous sign-in
- ✅ **Session management** - Create and join sessions with 6-digit codes
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - Live session synchronization
- ✅ **Mobile build working** - Successfully runs on mobile devices
- ✅ **Backend models tested** - Unit tests for data models

### Firebase Integration Complete
- ✅ **Firebase fully integrated** - Core, Auth, Firestore, and Storage
- ✅ **Authentication configured** - Email and anonymous auth working
- ✅ **Firestore security rules** - Comprehensive access control
- ✅ **Real-time database** - Live updates for collaborative features

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate Next Tasks
1. **Test Phase 2 Implementation** - Verify authentication and session management
2. **Begin Phase 3** - OCR & Receipt Processing
3. **Set up external API integrations** - Google Vision API and OpenAI

### Phase 3 Preparation Needed
Before starting Phase 3, you'll need to:

1. **Enable External APIs** in your Google Cloud Console:
   - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Enable **Vision API** for OCR processing
   - Get API credentials for the Flutter app

2. **Set up OpenAI Integration**:
   - Get **OpenAI API key** for GPT-powered receipt parsing
   - Configure secure API calls through Firebase Functions

3. **Prepare for Receipt Processing**:
   - Set up image upload functionality
   - Design receipt parsing workflow
   - Create manual editing interface

## 🎯 Current Milestone
