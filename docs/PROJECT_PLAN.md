# SplitDine MVP Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
SplitDine is a collaborative restaurant bill splitting app that makes it easy, fair, and fast for groups to split restaurant bills through real-time collaboration, OCR receipt scanning, and optional payment integration.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter (iOS & Android)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Functions, Storage)
- **OCR**: Google Vision API
- **AI Parsing**: OpenAI GPT API
- **Payments**: Stripe Connect
- **Real-time**: Firestore real-time listeners

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation
**Goal**: Establish development environment and project structure
- Set up Flutter development environment
- Initialize Firebase project with all required services
- Create comprehensive documentation structure
- Configure version control and basic CI/CD
- Establish coding standards and development workflows

### Phase 2: Backend Infrastructure
**Goal**: Build robust, scalable backend foundation
- Design and implement Firestore database schema
- Set up Firebase Authentication (email/phone + anonymous)
- Create Firebase Functions for secure API calls
- Implement real-time session management
- Configure comprehensive security rules

### Phase 3: OCR & Receipt Processing
**Goal**: Enable intelligent receipt scanning and parsing
- Integrate Google Vision API for OCR
- Build OpenAI-powered receipt parsing
- Implement receipt validation and editing UI
- Set up Firebase Storage for receipt images
- Create end-to-end processing pipeline

### Phase 4: Core App Features
**Goal**: Build main collaborative splitting functionality
- Session creation and participant joining
- Real-time item assignment interface
- Fair bill splitting algorithms
- Participant management and permissions
- Live split visualization
- QR code generation and scanning

### Phase 5: Payment Integration
**Goal**: Enable seamless payment processing
- Stripe Connect integration
- Payment flow user interface
- Settlement system between participants
- Security and PCI compliance
- Payment history and digital receipts

### Phase 6: Testing & Polish
**Goal**: Ensure quality and prepare for launch
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing
- UI/UX testing and refinement
- Performance optimization
- Security audit and hardening
- Deployment preparation

## Key User Flows

### Organizer Flow
1. Create new session (can be done before arriving)
2. Share join code via WhatsApp or QR
3. Scan receipt at the table
4. Review and edit parsed items
5. Assign items or allow participants to choose
6. Confirm final split
7. Handle payment (optional)

### Participant Flow
1. Join session via code/link
2. View shared receipt items
3. Assign items to themselves
4. See live updates as others choose
5. Confirm their share
6. Pay organizer if using in-app payment

## Technical Considerations

### Real-time Collaboration
- Firestore listeners for instant updates
- Optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution
- Efficient data synchronization patterns

### Data Privacy & Security
- Minimal data retention policy
- Secure API key management
- PCI compliance for payments
- User data encryption

### Scalability
- Efficient Firestore queries
- Image optimization and compression
- Serverless architecture with Firebase Functions
- Cost-effective data archival strategy

## Success Metrics
- Session completion rate
- User retention after first use
- Average time to complete bill split
- Payment success rate
- User satisfaction scores

## Risk Mitigation
- OCR accuracy fallback with manual editing
- Offline capability for core features
- Payment failure handling and recovery
- API rate limiting and error handling
- User onboarding and education

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this implementation plan
2. Begin Phase 1 with development environment setup
3. Create detailed technical specifications for each phase
4. Establish regular review and feedback cycles
5. Set up project tracking and milestone management
