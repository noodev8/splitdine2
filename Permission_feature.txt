Host can set permissions at any time for a session. Any locked permissions will be made obvious that it is locked by the host if/when trying to access any

1 - Alow invites
If invites are not allowed, the guests see the options but get a message when trying to add a guest. For the session code, they get XXXXXX instead of the actual number

2 - Guest Choices
Allow the guest to add items (Put the restriction in the copy item option as well)
Allow guest to set an item price
Allow guest to edit item (name or set to shared/individual)

3 - Allocations
Allow a guest to allocate people to an item (restriction includes themeselves where the host takes total control)

The host will need a new screen to manage these permission and be aware of them, when a session is first created
