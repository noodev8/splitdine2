receipt_scan_screen

Receipt items should be removed (you did it the other way round)
The total and assignment total values should be displayed

Remove the x number for allocated

Allow tap on guest to assign/unnassign

Bring back separate buttons for Edit, copy and shared

Allow them to tap on shared and have it unshared

No need for the word individual for shared button. Just colour the shared or uncolour the shared

Remove "Assign All" - it happens but its rare that all guests have the same product

== Rules ==
== Structure ==

splitdine2_flutter - All the flutter code
splitdine2_server - All the express code
docs - Project documentation
datatabse - Holds DB_Schema whch is the latest schema for our project. You do not need to modify this. I refresh from DB
We use postgres and connect directly without a model abstraction
Test, diagnose and analyze the code to help you ensure it is released without bugs as much as possible

Do not run the server or flutter. I will do that.

Once you are done testing, clean up your logs and unused functions, files and methods
use underscore "_" for filenames, not dash "-"
Use AWT session ID for new screens to ensure correct route calls
Check the route parms before coding/calling them


== Flutter ==
Always use app_config.dart to identify which IP to use when calling APIs. Do not hard code an IP address

Use the them, colour, design style from the session_lobby_screen.dart file. Use materal 3.

Keep all UI widgets, styles in the same file as the screen itself. Do not import styles.

== Express Server ==
Always use POST
Always return a standard result "SUCCESS" or error message
