== Rules ==
== Structure ==

splitdine2_flutter - All the flutter code
splitdine2_server - All the express code
docs - Project documentation
datatabse - Holds DB_Schema whch is the latest schema for our project. You do not need to modify this. I refresh from DB
We use postgres and connect directly without a model abstraction
Test, diagnose and analyze the code to help you ensure it is released without bugs as much as possible

Do not run the server or flutter. I will do that.

Once you are done testing, clean up your logs and unused functions, files and methods
use underscore "_" for filenames, not dash "-"
Use AWT session ID for new screens to ensure correct route calls
Check the route parms before coding/calling them


== Flutter ==
Always use app_config.dart to identify which IP to use when calling APIs. Do not hard code an IP address

Use the them, colour, design style from the session_lobby_screen.dart file. Use materal 3.

Keep all UI widgets, styles in the same file as the screen itself. Do not import styles.

== Express Server ==
Always use POST
Always return a standard result "SUCCESS" or error message
