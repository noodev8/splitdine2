receipt_scan_screen


Popup Calculator to enter time has the save and delete buttons far too close to the bottom. Make everything smaller if have no space or increase the popup size

Lets adjust the TOTAL. Do not use a card now, but instead out the total in the top card underneath "Receipt Items"

When deleting an item, no need for the green breadcrumb at the bottom

Kind of new. I want to add a new item. Can we have somewhere to add a new item and then bring up the pop to enter the values. If easier, by all means add to the database and use the edit functionality in the popup. Whichever easier.

When first entering the popup to edit price. Once the user taps on a number, clear the current total and put their new number to build from. Only do this for the first tap when the window opens.

No need to have delete on the popup, we do that before we get there.

== Rules ==
== Structure ==

splitdine2_flutter - All the flutter code
splitdine2_server - All the express code
docs - Project documentation
datatabse - Holds DB_Schema whch is the latest schema for our project. You do not need to modify this. I refresh from DB
We use postgres and connect directly without a model abstraction
Test, diagnose and analyze the code to help you ensure it is released without bugs as much as possible

Do not run the server or flutter. I will do that.

Once you are done testing, clean up your logs and unused functions, files and methods
use underscore "_" for filenames, not dash "-"
Use AWT session ID for new screens to ensure correct route calls
Check the route parms before coding/calling them


== Flutter ==
Always use app_config.dart to identify which IP to use when calling APIs. Do not hard code an IP address

Use the them, colour, design style from the session_lobby_screen.dart file. Use materal 3.

Keep all UI widgets, styles in the same file as the screen itself. Do not import styles.

== Express Server ==
Always use POST
Always return a standard result "SUCCESS" or error message
